## Course Structure 

The course spans across 12 weeks, covering the following core modules:

1. **[Development Tools](development-tools.md)** and concepts to build models and apps.
2. **[Deployment Tools](deployment-tools.md)** and concepts to publish what you built.
3. **[Large Language Models](large-language-models.md)** that make your work easier and your apps smarter.
4. **[Data Sourcing](data-sourcing.md)** to extract data from the web, files, and databases.
5. **[Data Preparation](data-preparation.md)** to clean and restructure inputs.
6. **[Data Analysis](data-analysis.md)** to discover valuable insights.
7. **[Data Visualization](data-visualization.md)** to communicate insights through storytelling.

## Why take this course?

Courses typically teach you the theory behind programming and data science—from statistics to algorithms to training models. However, selecting the right tools and mastering them is a crucial skill rarely covered in standard curriculum. For example:

- **Sourcing**: Instead of relying on pristine CSVs, you'll learn to scrape, clean, and join noisy data from the wild.
- **Efficiency**: Instead of taking weeks to write custom parsers, you'll utilize terminal superpowers to manipulate text.
- **AI Integration**: You will learn how to integrate LLMs directly into your data pipelines for parsing, formatting, and classification.

By learning these tools well, you'll be significantly more productive in real-world data science roles. Be prepared, this course is challenging and pushes you to independently solve complex problems!

# Tools in Data Science (TDS) - Knowledge Base

Welcome to the **Tools in Data Science** (TDS) student manual repository. 
This project is an organized, comprehensive guide for the diploma-level data science course at IIT Madras, taught by Professor S. Anand.

## Overview
This repository contains a modern, statically-generated documentation website built with React and Vite. It serves as a centralized knowledge base to help students learn practical data science tools, including:

- **Data Sourcing** (Scraping, APIs, Databases)
- **Data Preparation** (Cleaning, Formatting, Pandas)
- **Data Analysis** (Querying, Statistical Modeling)
- **Data Visualization** (Storytelling, Dashboards)
- **Deployment** (Docker, Git, Web Apps)
- **AI Integration** (LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Automations)

The project includes custom styles, an embedded search engine, and structured Markdown guides that have been split for readability.

## Local Development
